# RSI-SMA
Supervised machine learning for stock price prediction and technical analysis for generating buy and sell signals

Use RSI and SMA indicators for predict Buy and Sell signal for Thailand stocks

this example is quite basic and may need further refinement for practical use. Also, you'll need to implement the calculate_rsi function to calculate the Relative Strength Index (RSI), as it's used as a feature in the model. Additionally, you may want to experiment with different machine learning models, hyperparameters, and features to improve the forecasting accuracy.
